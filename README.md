## Dynamic Pricing API

`POST /api/pricing/calculate` recalculates and saves a seller's product price.
Send a bearer token for a seller account (or an admin account) and a JSON body
containing `productId` and the editable pricing values `basePrice`,
`demandScore`, `stock`, `priceFloor`, and `priceCeiling`. A positive numeric
`competitorPrice` is optional. Recalculation saves these values and the
calculated `currentPrice`. Sellers can only reprice their own products.

The calculation starts from `basePrice` or the lower of `basePrice` and
`competitorPrice`, applies a demand adjustment of up to 10% based on
`demandScore` (0–100, with 50 neutral), adds 5% when stock is 1–5, and
subtracts 5% when stock is at least 50. The result is rounded to two decimal
places and clamped to the product's `priceFloor` and `priceCeiling`. The
response includes the saved `currentPrice`.

`GET /api/products/mine` returns the authenticated seller's products for the
vendor pricing dashboard. Admin accounts can use this endpoint to list all
products.
